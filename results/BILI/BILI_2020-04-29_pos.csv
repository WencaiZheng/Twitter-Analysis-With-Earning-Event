2020-04-29 17:05:35,2020-04-29 17:05:35-04:00,DrJonesWales,Thank you so much for your kind words @NevilleSouthall ! I’m a big fan of @walesape &amp; absolutely loved the privilege of being able to film Bili &amp; Titch’s rescues. I cannot wait to see them both again &amp; know the sanctuary must be struggling in the current climate! @CUBiosciences https://t.co/cFuGnz0fXW,1,2020-04-29 21:05:35,4687
2020-04-29 17:24:42,2020-04-29 17:24:42-04:00,DrJonesWales,"We filmed both Bili &amp; Titch’s rescues for #RhysJonesWildlifePatrol but now my friends at @walesape really do need your help to remain open! Here’s a link to their ‘Go Fund Me’ page, please help if you are able to, or consider retweeting if not, thank you!
